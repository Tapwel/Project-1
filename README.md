# Simulated Time Server and Client
The objective of this project is to create a networking application where a client can request the current time from a server.
It focuses on foundational networking concepts such as sockets, threading, and TCP communication.

The expected outcomes include:
A server that provides real-time responses to client requests.
A client that requests and displays server responses.
And an enhanced understanding of networking principles through practical implementation.

Instructions:
To run the application, start the server using python main.py.
Then, run the client to interact with the server.
During troubleshooting, ensure the server is running and check for any firewall rules that might block connections.
